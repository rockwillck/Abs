# Abs.

Juicy. Luscious. Abs.

Generate these beautiful pieces of human art using this abs generator, a messy pile of spaghetti code I wrote in an hour.

## Problems

Sometimes the abs look like faces. Sometimes they cross over themselves. But is that really a problem?

## Implementation

This is a dead simple HTML Canvas and JS setup that runs with minimal memory and will render on basically any computer that can run snake.

## Demo
